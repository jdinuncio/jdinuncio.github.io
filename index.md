I love programming languages. Typed, untyped, compiled, interpreted,
you name it. The language that I use more often is [python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), 
the executable pseudocode.

Another languages that have always atracted me are:

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (when being lazy is a virtue).
* Smalltalk (or, in the same vein, [Self](http://www.selflanguage.org/)).
* Lisp (or better yet Scheme).
* Forth (or one of its bests incarnations, [Factor](http://factorcode.org/)).

I'm a python programmer, sysadmin, linux user and web developer (preferring the server side).
I fell in love with [Plone](https://plone.og), one of the bests CMS out there, 
and of course, made in python.

This is the place for my notes, thoughts and a playground.
