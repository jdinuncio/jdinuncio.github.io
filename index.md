I love programming languages. Typed, untyped, compiled, interpreted,
you name it. The language that I use more often is python, the
executable pseudocode.

Another languages that have always atracted me are:

* Lisp (or better yet Scheme).
* Smalltalk (or, in the same vein, self).
* Forth (or one of its bests incarnations, factor).
* Haskell.

I'm a sysadmin, linux user and web developer (preferring the server side).
I fell in love with plone, one of the bests CMS out there, and of course,
made in python.

This is the place for my notes, thoughts and a place to play.
